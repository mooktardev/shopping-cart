# Savana Shop

Welcome to our Ecommerce Website project! This project is built using React.js for the frontend and Vite.js for the build tooling. Below you will find information on how to set up the project, run it locally, and build it for production.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mooktardev/shopping-cart.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd shopping-cart
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   # or
   yarn

## Running the Development Server

```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production
